# phaser-flappy-bird ![icon](./assets/icon.jpeg)
yet another flappy bird clone built with phaser

## Intro

Clone the "flappy bird" game while playing around [phaser](https://phaser.io/). As this game is simple enough even for one person,  also it's good starting point to explore and get familiar with Phaser's core function and API. 

> The devil is in the detail

I Try to clone the full game and implement as much detail as I can. Including all the menu, text, animation, score dashboard, audio, etc. What's the fun if only  just make a rough demo ?
